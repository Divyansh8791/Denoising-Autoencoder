🚀 Denoising Autoencoder

📌 Overview
This repository contains a complete implementation of a Denoising Autoencoder, covering its architecture, theory, and real-world applications. Learn how to remove noise from images using deep learning with step-by-step code and explanations!

📖 What is a Denoising Autoencoder?
A Denoising Autoencoder is a type of neural network designed to reconstruct clean data from noisy inputs. It consists of two main components:

- **Encoder:** Compresses input data into a lower-dimensional latent space.
- **Decoder:** Reconstructs the original data from the compressed representation.

Autoencoders are widely used for image denoising, feature extraction, and anomaly detection.
